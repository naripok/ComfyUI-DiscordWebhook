# ComfyUI-DiscordWebhook

A very simple Discord webhook integration node for ComfyUI that lets you post images and text.

# Usage

On first use, you will need to use the "Set Discord Webhook" node to set your webhook URL. Create a blank workflow and add the two nodes from the Discord category for Set and Use Discord Webhook.

Connect them together and you should see a test image sent to your Discord channel if you configured your webhook correctly.
